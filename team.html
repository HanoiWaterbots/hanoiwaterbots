              <h6>Computer Engineering, Year 2</h6>
              <p>I am the Project Coordinator of Hanoi Waterbots. Last year I participated in a similar experiential learning project called Mindoro Swarmbots and that inspired me to apply for funding for my own project. I have a knack for building electronics and love experimenting hardware gadgets. I have experience working with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, SenseHat etc. alongwith coding expertise in C++, Python and building chatbots. Through this challenging transdisciplinary project, I aim to upgrade my leadership skills, programming abilities and technical proficiency.</p>

              <h6>Computer Science, Year 2</h6>
              <p>I have a keen interest in problem-solving and computer programming. I also like to work with electronics as a hobby. I have participated in a few hackathons and have experience in server-side programming in languages like Node.js and Python. I am familiar with cloud computing services like AWS, Microsoft Azure, Heroku and have worked with SQL and Mongo databases. In addition, I have experience working with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and ESP for IoT applications. Presently, a part of TecHKU, I am working actively with a team of developers to build campus-life solutions at HKU.</p>

              <p>Since the beginning of my mechanical engineering studies, I started my interest in studying robotics. I have solid experience in DIY and crafting in my secondary school life, from the Design and Technology club activity and related competition(Infrastructure Building Competition for Secondary Schools and Solar RC car contest). I recently worked in the construction of "Donkey Car", which is a DIY self driving RC car that involves Raspberry Pi and Python.</p>

            <h6>Computer Engineering, Year 4</h6>
            <p>I have extensive experience in mobile app and web development. I also have experience in Arduino programming on a course project, in which I connected the Arduino board to wifi and sent the data collected from the sensor to cloud. Moreover, my machine learning and data analysis skills may be helpful in processing and analyzing the pollution data. I sincerely hope that my technical skills are not only used for earning moneys, but also for helping with the issues that are crucial but less people pay attention to.</p>

            <p>I believe this to be an amazing opportunity to use the knowledge and skills I have acquired over the years for a fruitful cause. Furthermore, I solemnly believe that this is a great venue to explore and improve my knowledge and understanding about real-life applications of classroom taught material. Given the aforementioned reasoning I believe I present myself as a viable candidate for this project.</p>

            <p> As I understand you need someone to map the data that is collected during the project and be able to efficiently display the important findings from the same, my experience from past 6 years of working with JAVA allows me to be very familiar with the GUI part of the language. This makes me very capable for making the programs required by the project. Furthermore, studying advanced linear algebra as a part of my math minor lets me have good knowledge about how to perform required transformations of the data provided. </p>

            <p>I joined the Cambodia Internship last summer and studied the villagers plastic waste treatment and provided education and basic health care to the villagers and those PUC university students. I believe I have acquired related studies in Biological field (Marine biology 3301 and 4301) as well as Toxicology (BIOL3109, 3110). I would like to apply the knowledge I have learnt in textbook to serve the local people and at the same time learning more about the situation on the Vietnam marine lives and the relationship to the livelihood of the local villagers. </p>

            <p>With the data collected, a reusable and maintainable project will be created to monitor the levels of pollution in the Red river, which will bring strong impact for the local communities to take care more of the habitable surroundings. Furthermore, I would like to ensure the integrity of the data that the waterbots will be collecting. I believe I can help with the database collection and visualization for this project, which will definitely deepen the understanding of the pollution of the Red river for local people.</p>

            <p>Being a Vietnamese myself, I am aware of the pollution situation, the urgent need to deal with the problem, and yet the limiting solutions to my home country. Therefore, this project will enable me to find out the causes of the pollution, learn more about project design and implementation, and create benefits to the affected community in Viet Nam in the future. Besides the above reasons, I believe my past experiences will enable me to contribute to the development of the project.</p>

For that project I have done frontend coding and hardware design for the water meter project. I couldn't go to Myanmar due to schedule clash with on another trip. I believe I am one of the most well-versed student in practical skills in electronics and embedded engineering, especially in hardware design and integration. I am a core member in the HKU robocon team and have been designing circuit boards, control algorithms and user interface software for the robocon competition for over 2 years.</p>
